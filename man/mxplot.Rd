\arguments{
\item{...}{xts or ggplot objects, or a list of ggplot objects. If it's a list, only the 1st item works.}

\item{theme}{the theme to apply}

\item{titles}{a vector of titles.}

\item{heights}{the weight of the height of plots, eg. heights = c(2,1)}

\item{size}{line width}

\item{end_spacing}{extend the space at the end of plot, as a percentage of the size of xlim().}
